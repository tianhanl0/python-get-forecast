## metadata plot
- following plot shows total infected cell in each brain and how are they differs between each virus

## overall plot
- following plots gives a brief intro to the overall dataset within levels of virus, route and time point
- total infected cell is the number of infected cell infected at each level
- number of brain is the number of brain been tested at each level
- infected cell per brian: total infected cell divided by number of brain at each level

### time point plot
- folloing plot specifically see how virus differs at each time point
- conclusion from this graph: 
  - speed of virus entering the brain: VEEV > EEEV > WEEV

### route plot
- following plot specifically see how virus differs at each route
- conclusion from this graph: 
  - for virus VEEV: route aerosol is more aggressive than route subcutaneous
  - for virus EEEV: route subcutaneous is more aggressive than route aerosol

### percentange difference plot
- following plot shows the percentage difference with respect to first time point at each pane
- conclusion from this graph:
  - Speed of the virus spread inside the brain: VEEV_aerosol > EEEV_subcutaneous > EEEV_aerosol > VEEV_subcutaneous > WEEV

### box plot
- following plot also shows the overall dataset within levels of virus, route and time point
- each point on the plot represent one brain been tested (above plot show s the average value, this plot shows each values inside)
- problems seen from this graph:
  - larger the box, greater the variance (some test results are unstable, especially when number of brains been tested is low, the conclusion draw from above graphs maybe incredible.)
